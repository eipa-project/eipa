Emotionally Intelligent Personal Assistant

#### *(Under Development)*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this project we are trying to build a Personal Assistant which can correctly, detect a user’s query regardless of his accent, detect a user’s emotional state and respond accordingly. We are also trying to build a sub-module which can detect whether a person is in depression.
